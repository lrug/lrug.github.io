# Setting up an Eventbrite page for an LRUG meeting

As part of [organising a meeting](/organising/organising-a-meeting) you'll want to set up an [eventbrite][eventbrite] page to let people register.  Here's the detailed steps for doing that.

1. On **Manage my events** find the previous month's event (you may need to filter by past to see it)
2. Hit **Copy Event**, this creates a duplicate of the previous month's event and you buff the edges off to make it look fresh and new
   1. Change title from "Copy of LRUG `<month>` `<year>`" to "LRUG `<next month>` `<year>`"
   2. Ditto for the short description - we usually leave this quite sparse.
   3. Set the date correctly, the time will usually be fine: 6:20pm -> 8pm UK time
   4. Leave **Copy the online event page** option unchecked - we'll recreate that later
   5. Hit **Copy event**
3. On the **Details** tab:
   1. Remove the existing header image if there is one
   2. If you feel creative, add one that's appropriate for the season.  Make sure to refer to the licence and attribution in the description if necessary
   3. Update the description to talk about the month your meeting is for.
   4. Hit **Save**
4. On the **Online event page** tab:
   1. Add a **live video or audio** via **link another provider** - we don't directly integrate our eventbrite and zoom accounts because .. I don't know, it seems weird and to want permissions over our zoom account that feel unnecessary
   2. **Title**: "Zoom URL for LRUG `<month>` `<year>` meeting"
   3. **Description**: take the meeting invite text from zoom and cut it down to just the url and the meeting id/passcode details
   4. **Url**: the meeting url from the zoom invite
   5. Hit **Save**
   6. Hit **Continue**
5. On the **Tickets** tab:
   1. Event capacity is 95 - our zoom account allows for 100 people, and leaving 5 spare keeps space for hosts + speakers should we ever need to.
   2. Add ticket types - you can get creative here or not - set them to go on sale "now" and end at 6pm on the day of the meeting.  Doesn't matter how many of each ticket you specify as we limit the overall event to 95 capacity
   3. The tickets should all be: Free, etickets, visible now, max 1
   4. Hit **Next**
6. On the **Publish** tab:
   1. Hit **Publish** - everything should be ready now.
7. On the **Order Options** menu - click to open the **Waitlist Settings** tab
   1. Hit **Enable** - the default settings are fine: **Enable waitlist when total event capacity is reached** with no maximum size
   2. Hit **Save**
8. On the **Manage attendees** menu - click to open the **Emails to attendees** tab
   1. Check that it's queued up a few emails with reminders - the "Starting now!" one will have the link to the online event page
9. Click on the meeting title in the side bar and grab the "Event URL" to use in the LRUG.org writeup

You're done!
